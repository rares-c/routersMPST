# Protocol conformance verification tool
This tool was developed as part of the Bachelor's project of Rares Dobre. Supervisors: Bas van den Heuvel, Jorge A. PÃ©rez.


## Requirements
- Node - download [link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- npm - installation guide [link](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

## How to run the project
To run a router process for a given participant, the modules have to be installed first, and then the router can be started. Execute

```
npm install
``` 

in a terminal window. After all the node modules have been installed, the router processes can be started. Each router process needs the specification of the protocol in JSON format. Inside the JSON file corresponding to the given protocol, the implementing party must be specified, the port on which the router will listen, the other participants, and the global type. For an example, please see the protocol specification from `./CSA Suite/authorization/CSA_authorization.JSON`. Please note that there is no need to have separate files for each implementing party, as the same file can be edited after starting a router process such that it fits a different implementing party. Yet, in the current CSA suite, different specification files were used for conveniency. After defining the protocol specification, the routers can be started. To start a router process, execute:

```
PROTOCOL_PATH=<PATH> node router.js
```

Where `<PATH>` is replaced by the path to the protocol specification file. The actual participant implementations must be started before the routers, because the participants must wait for the "green light" from the routers. That is, once the routers check that the network of routers is up and running, and that every router is connected to its participant implementation, the communication can begin. Thus, first start up all the participant implementations, then start all the routers. Once all the routers are connected, the transmission will commence.

--- 
To execute the CSA test suite, the following commands must be executed. We recommend 6 different terminal windows to thoroughly observe the progress of the routers and the message exchanges. 2 terminal windows are needed for each participant, one for the implementation, and one for the router. First, start up all the implementing parties.

The Client service can be started using: 
```
node CSA\ suite/client/client.js
```

Afterwards, the Authorization service can be started:
```
node CSA\ suite/authorization/authorization.js
```

At last, the Server can be started using:
```
node CSA\ suite/server/server.js
```

Next, start up all the routers.

For the Client Router, execute in a terminal:
```
PROTOCOL_PATH="./CSA Suite/client/CSA_client.json" node router.js
```
For the Server Router, execute in a different terminal:
```
PROTOCOL_PATH="./CSA Suite/server/CSA_server.json" node router.js
```
For the Authorization Router, execute in a different terminal:
```
PROTOCOL_PATH="./CSA Suite/authorization/CSA_authorization.json" node router.js
```

The start up order of the implementing parties is irrelevant. Same holds for the routers. However, all implementing parties must be started before the actual routers. Failure to start an implementing party before its router will yield an error, and the router process will terminate. 

--- 
To execute the Untrusted Endpoints test suite, the following commands must be executed. We recommend 6 different terminal windows to thoroughly observe the progress of the routers and the message exchanges. Additionally, the Untrusted Endpoints suite makes use of a weather API `openweathermap`. For this test suite to work, the user needs to have a (free) account on `openweathermap.com`, as the API needs an API key. You can easily make an account by following this [link](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up). The database currently holds the coordinates of 6 different cities: Groningen, Amsterdam, Zwolle, London, Bucharest, and Bern.

The Client service can be started using: 
```
node Untrusted\ suite/client/client.js
```

Afterwards, the Database service can be started:
```
node Untrusted\ suite/database/db.js
```

At last, the weather wrapper can be started using:
```
node Untrusted\ suite/weather/weatherwrapper.js
```

Next, start up all the routers.

For the Client Router, execute in a terminal:
```
PROTOCOL_PATH="./Untrusted suite/client/untrusted.JSON" node router.js
```
For the Database Server Router, execute in a different terminal:
```
PROTOCOL_PATH="./Untrusted suite/database/untrusted.JSON" node router.js
```
For the Weather Wrapper Router, execute in a different terminal:
```
PROTOCOL_PATH="./Untrusted suite/weather/untrusted.JSON" node router.js
```
